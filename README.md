## Architecture 

This project follows a twist of MVVM without the two way binding by using the [stacked](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked) package. The architecture has three pillars: Views, ViewModels, and Services.

- `Views` are the UI you see in the application. Views should have minimum logic to them, all the logic should really be handled in its corresponding ViewModel. In other words, Views should only render the state of its ViewModel...like React, declarative.

- `ViewModels` make use of different services to achieve what the user is requesting through their interactions. It manages the state of the View and contains business logic that can manipulate the data the View needs. It does this by making use of Services. I prefer to have a 1:1 relationship with a View and a ViewModel because it makes it easy to reason about and also keeps your file structure clean. I find only in rare cases can you reuse a ViewModel with different Views (good or bad thing? After a week into Flutter, I'm not too sure ðŸ˜…). 

- `Services` provide the functionality of various features your app needs. I create a Service per feature so if I need authentication, I create an [AuthenticationService](https://github.com/phc5/startuper/blob/master/lib/services/authentication.dart). The kind folks at FilledStacks created a packaged called [stacked_services](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked_services) that includes some commonly used functionalities like navigation, dialog, and snackbar. 


In our views, we use `ViewModelBuilder` to bind our Views to our ViewModels. `ViewModelBuilder` has two constructors: `.reactive()` and `.nonReactive()`. When a function in our ViewModel calls `notifyListeners()`, the Views with the `.reactive()` constructor will react to the changes and rebuild your UI with the newly updated ViewModel state.

There's much more to the `stacked` architecture and I've only scratched the surface. I'm interested to see how well this scales.
